# P.E.T - Personal Expense Tracking App

The main goal of this project is to enhance my Python skills by developing a Personal Expense Tracking (P.E.T) app. I plan to expand upon the project from this repository: [Original Code](https://github.com/pixegami/python-for-beginners/tree/main/12%20-%20Final%20Project)


## âœ… Tasks

1. Create web version with frontend via Flask.
2. Connected web app with NoSQL via MongoDB.
3. Create smoke tests.

By completing these tasks, I aim to transform the P.E.T app into a fully functional web application with frontend capabilities, seamless integration with a NoSQL database, and comprehensive smoke tests to ensure robustness and reliability.
